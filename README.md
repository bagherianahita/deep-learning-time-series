# CNN-LSTM Time Series Prediction

This repository contains a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model for time series forecasting.  
The model combines CNN layers for local feature extraction with LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions on sequential datasets.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for time series data  
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- Visualization of loss curves and prediction results  

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
